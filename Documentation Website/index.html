      <section id="Hello_world">
        <h2>Hello world</h2>
        <article>
          To get started with writing Python, open the Visual Studio Code and write
          your first "Hello world" Python code:
          <code>
            print("Hello, World!")

            # Try these also!(This is a comment)
            print("Welcome to the world of Python!")
            print("This is a simple script for beginners.")
            print("Feel free to modify and experiment with the code.")
          </code>

      <section id="Variables">
        <h2>Variables</h2>
        <article>
         <ul>
                <b>Dynamic Typing:</b>
            <li>
                Python is dynamically typed, meaning you don't need to declare the type of a variable explicitly.
            </li>
            <li>
                Variables can dynamically change their type during execution.
            </li>
                <b>Variable Declaration:</b>
            <li>
                To create a variable, choose a name and assign it a value using the assignment operator (=).
            </li>
            <li>
                For example, x = 10 creates a variable named x with the value 10.
            </li>
                <b>Data Types:</b>
            <li>
                Variables in Python can hold various data types, including integers, floats, strings, lists, and more.
            </li>
            <li>
                The interpreter determines the type based on the assigned value.
            </li>
               <b>Variable Naming Conventions:</b>
            <li>
                Follow naming conventions for variables, such as starting with a letter or underscore.
            </li>
            <li>
                Choose descriptive names that convey the purpose of the variable.
            </li>
                <b>Reassigning Variables:</b>
            <li>
                You can easily reassign values to variables throughout your code.
            </li>
            <li>
                For example, x = 10 can later be changed to x = "Hello".
            </li>
                <b>Variable Scope:</b>
            <li>
                Understand the concept of variable scope, whether it's local within a function or global across the entire program.
            </li>
                <b>Printing Variables:</b>
            <li>
                Use the print() function to display the value of a variable and inspect the output during development.
            </li>
                <b>Best Practices:</b>
            <li>
                Write clean and readable code by choosing meaningful variable names and organizing them logically.
            </li>
            <li>
                Avoid using reserved words as variable names to prevent conflicts.
            </li>
                <b>Arithmetic with Variables:</b>
            <li>
                Perform arithmetic operations directly with variables, for example, total = x + y.
            </li>
                <b>Adaptability:</b>
            <li>
                Leverage the adaptability of Python variables to handle different data types and facilitate dynamic programming.
            </li>
