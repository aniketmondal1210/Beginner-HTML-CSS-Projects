          <h2>Father of the Nation</h2>
          <p>
            <b>Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi</b> ( October 2, 1869 â€“ January 30, 1948
            ) A key figure in India's fight for independence from British rule, Gandhi pioneered the philosophy of nonviolent resistance, or Satyagraha. His commitment to ahimsa (nonviolence) and truth shaped the course of history.
            Gandhi's activism began in South Africa, where he fought against racial discrimination, laying the foundation for his later endeavors in India. He returned to India in 1915 and became a prominent leader in the Indian National Congress.
            Gandhi's leadership was marked by iconic movements, including the Salt March in 1930, a protest against the British salt monopoly. He advocated for self-reliance, communal harmony, and equality. The Quit India Movement in 1942, urging an end to British rule, showcased his unwavering commitment to independence.
            Tragically, Gandhi's life was cut short when he was assassinated on January 30, 1948, by Nathuram Godse. Despite his death, his principles left an indelible mark on the world. His philosophy of nonviolence influenced civil rights movements globally, including Martin Luther King Jr. in the United States.
            Gandhi's legacy extends beyond politics, emphasizing simplicity, truth, and the pursuit of justice. He remains an enduring symbol of peaceful resistance, and his birthday, October 2, is celebrated as the International Day of Non-Violence.
            Mahatma Gandhi's impact on the world is immeasurable, his life embodying the transformative power of nonviolence in the face of oppression. His teachings continue to inspire individuals and movements worldwide, standing as a testament to the enduring force of peaceful activism.
